# Online Store Frontend Web App


## Introduction
This is an online store frontend web application built with React, TypeScript, React Redux, React Query, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to browse through a list of products, view individual product details, add products to their cart, and perform product searches. The application fetches product data from the [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) and utilizes React Query for data fetching and caching.

## Pages

- Single Product View: Allows users to view detailed information about a specific product.
- Cart: Enables users to add products to their cart for purchase.
- Search Bar: Users can search for specific products using the search bar.
- Responsive Design: The application is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
